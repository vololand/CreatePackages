# Inno Setup Dependency Installer

![Inno Setup Dependency Installer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/341158/122873592-3e2e9d80-d332-11eb-8055-8a4c6064ac4e.gif)

**Inno Setup Dependency Installer** can download and install any dependency such as .NET, Visual C++ or SQL Server during your application's installation. In addition, it is easy to add your own dependencies as well.

## Installation and Usage

1. Download and install [Inno Setup 6.4+](https://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).
2. Download [this repository](https://github.com/DomGries/InnoDependencyInstaller/archive/master.zip) or clone it.
3. Open the extracted _ExampleSetup.iss_ file.
4. Comment out dependency function calls inside _InitializeSetup_ function to disable installing them:
    ```iss
    Dependency_AddVC2013; // installed in example setup
    //Dependency_AddVC2013; // commented out and not installed in example setup
    ```
5. Modify other sections like _[Setup] [Files] [Icons]_ as necessary.
6. Build the setup using Inno Setup compiler.

## Integration

You can also just include _CodeDependencies.iss_ file into your setup and call the desired _Dependency_Add_ functions (some may need defining their exe file path before the include):

```iss
#include "CodeDependencies.iss"

[Setup]
; ...

[Code]
function InitializeSetup: Boolean;
begin
  // add the dependencies you need
  Dependency_AddDotNet90;
  // ...

  Result := True;
end;
```

## Details

You have two ways to distribute the dependency installers. By default, most dependencies will be downloaded from the official website. Another way is to pack the dependency into a single executable setup like so:

* Include the dependency setup file by defining the source:

    ```iss
    Source: "dxwebsetup.exe"; Flags: dontcopy noencryption
    ```

* Call _ExtractTemporaryFile()_ before the corresponding _Dependency_Add_ function

    ```iss
    ExtractTemporaryFile('dxwebsetup.exe');
    ```

The dependencies are installed based on the system architecture. If you want to install 32-bit dependencies on a 64-bit system you can force 32-bit mode like so:

```iss
Dependency_ForceX86 := True; // force 32-bit install of next dependencies
Dependency_AddVC2013;
Dependency_ForceX86 := False; // disable forced 32-bit install again
```

If you only deploy 32-bit binaries and dependencies you can also instead just not define [ArchitecturesInstallIn64BitMode](https://jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setup_architecturesinstallin64bitmode) in [Setup].
